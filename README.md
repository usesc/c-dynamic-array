# c-dynamic-array 
A Dynamic Array Implementation in The C Programming language. 1 header file, 1 source file. 

All the definitions you might need for reference are located in the header file, and they are quite easy to read.

Tutorial guide is in test.c, should be pretty easy to understand.

My last dynamic array implementation (uvec) kind of sucked so I did a rerun. 

requirements: 
1. C compiler
2. C Standard Library
